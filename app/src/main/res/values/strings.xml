        contributes to the understanding of his background later in the novel.</string>

        \"His face darkened with some powerful emotion.\"</string>

        creates an image of a sharp-eyed figure focused on one object or person; in this case, he is focused on Hester Prynne, who is standing outside the prison gates.
        like a very secretive as he puts his finger to his lips when making eye contact with Hester Prynne. This initial observation </string>
